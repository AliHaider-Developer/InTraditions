      <span> Origins:</span> The history of Ajrak dates back over 4,000 years, with roots in the ancient Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeological findings, such as the statue of the King Priest from Mohenjo-Daro, depict garments with patterns similar to those found in modern Ajrak designs.
      Ajrak has been a part of the Sindhi culture for centuries, often worn by men as a turban, shawl, or scarf, and by women as a dupatta or shawl. It is also used in various ceremonial contexts, including weddings and religious festivals.</p>
